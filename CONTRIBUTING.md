# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project!  
We welcome contributions from everyone, but we ask that you follow a few guidelines.

---

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

This project uses the [Developer Certificate of Origin](DCO.md) to confirm that contributions are made with the right to submit them under the project's license.

**By contributing, you agree to the terms of the DCO.**

### Sign-off Process

Each commit must include a `Signed-off-by` line, which certifies compliance with the DCO.

```bash
This is my commit message

Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>
```
You can add this automatically in CLI using the `-s` flag with `git commit`:

```bash
git commit -s -m "Your commit message"
```
This will append a line like:

```bash
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```
