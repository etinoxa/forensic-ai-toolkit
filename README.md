## 📌 Overview
Forensics AI Toolkit (FAIT) transforms the speed, accuracy, and scalability of digital forensic investigations by combining **AI-powered analysis** with **human-validated insights**.

### Key Features
- **AI-powered pattern recognition**
- **Multi-modal evidence processing** (images, audio, documents)
- **Human-in-the-loop verification** for legal compliance
- **Secure, privacy-focused architecture**

---

## ⚠ Challenges in Traditional Forensics
- **Time Constraints** – Manual evidence review causes delays.
- **Human Error** – Fatigue and bias impact accuracy.
- **Scalability Issues** – Exploding volumes of digital evidence.
- **Skill Gaps** – Shortage of advanced forensic expertise.

---

## 🚀 FAIT’s AI-Based Solution
### Core Capabilities
- **Computer Vision** – Facial recognition, object detection.
- **NLP & RAG** – Legal document parsing, receipt interpretation, multi-language OCR.
- **Audio Analysis** – Voice matching, background noise location inference.
- **Secure Processing** – Role-based access, encryption, GDPR/CCPA/FBI compliance.

---

## 🛠 Technical Architecture
- **Python Data Extraction** – `pytsk3`, `pyewf`, `python-magic`, `hashlib`
- **Visual Analysis** – FaceNet, ArcFace, CLIP, OWL-ViT, DETR, GroundingDINO
- **Audio Models** – Wav2Vec2, ECAPA-TDNN, X-Vector
- **Integration** – Evidence & case management systems, secure reporting

---

## 📊 Performance
- **Faster Analysis** – Reduced evidence processing time
- **Accuracy** – Correct evidence identification rate
- **Throughput** – Higher case handling capacity

---

## 🏛 Societal Impact
- **Justice Acceleration** – Reduced case backlogs
- **Stronger Cases** – More complete evidence packages
- **Victim Support** – Faster closure for affected parties

---

## 🔐 Security & Privacy
- Air-gapped compatibility  
- End-to-end encryption  
- Role-based access control  
- Chain-of-custody maintenance  

---

## 📦 Deployment Workflow
1. **Evidence Ingestion** – Secure import + hash verification
2. **Automated AI Processing** – Logging & chain-of-custody retention
3. **Multi-Level QA** – Analyst & expert validation
4. **Maintenance** – Regular model updates
